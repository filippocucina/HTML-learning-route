--- Multimedia and Embedding ---

We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring
only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more
interesting content! This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed
video, audio, and even entire webpages.

--- Prerequisites ---

Before starting this module, you should have a reasonable understanding of the basics
 of HTML, as previously covered in Introduction to HTML. If you have not worked through
 this module (or something similar), work through it first, then come back!.

 There are several guides for this module. Look up the website.
